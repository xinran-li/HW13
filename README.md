# HW13# 
# Symphony No. 9

A music player that songs with light fleshes.

## Summary

First of all, I was thinking about just making a music player and using the light sensor to control the volume. But later I found that it will be more fun to write a coding that could play music by itself. However, I am not really good at music. Thus I have to do lots of research about rhythms and piths, and transfer them into coding. Additionally I had to consider the pose and the music metre or the music time.

Thus the final project is the music player that has a light flashing with the music plays.


## Component Parts
an Arduino, USB Cable, Breadboard, and a piezoÂ speaker
Defending the rhythm and timing. As well as the light.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

Week 1:came up with ideas
Week 2: researches 
- Week 3: coding and tests
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges
 
The is a challenge for me to analysis the rhythm and the array them into a song.
