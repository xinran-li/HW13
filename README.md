Your Project Title Here

One-sentence summary of your project goes here; then fill out each of the following sections.

## Summary

First of all, I was thinking about just making a music player and using the light sensor to control the volume. But later I found that it will be more fun to write a coding that could play music by itself. However, I am not really good at music. Thus I have to do lots of research about rhythms and piths, and transfer them into coding. Additionally I had to consider the pose and the music metre or the music time.

Thus the final project is the music player that has a light flashing with the music plays.


## Component Parts
an Arduino, USB Cable, Breadboard, and a piezoÂ speaker
Defending the rhythm and timing. As well as the light.
